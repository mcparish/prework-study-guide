# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was developed as an introduction into the process of learning HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.  This webpage allows for notes to be taken on all of the topics previously mentioned.  Through this process I was able to form the frame, style, and functionality of this webpage.  While working on this project I was able to identify and fix bugs found in the code.
